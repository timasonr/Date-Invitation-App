# Date Invitation App

A fun and interactive application that asks someone on a date. When the user clicks "Yes", a confirmation message appears. If they click "No", a playful joke message appears.

## Features

- Simple and intuitive graphical user interface
- Custom message boxes for responses
- Playful "threat" when user selects "No" (joke function that pretends it will delete system32)

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (usually included with Python)

## Usage

Run the application using Python:

```
python main.py
```

## Note

This is a joke application - it doesn't actually delete any files or shutdown your computer. The shutdown function is meant as a harmless prank.
